abstract: 'Wetland ecosystems play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles.
  In emergent vegetation targets, the occurrence of double-bounce scatter is indicative
  of the presence of water and can be valuable for hydrological monitoring. Double-bounce
  scatter would lead to an increase of $σ$0HH over $σ$0VV and a non-zero co-polarized
  phase difference (CPD). In the Lower Paraná River floodplain, a total of 11 full
  polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes from a wide range of incidence angles were acquired
  during a month. Flooded targets dominated by two herbaceous species were sampled:
  Schoenoplectus californicus (four sites, Bulrush marshes) and Ludwigia peruviana
  (three sites, Broadleaf marshes). As a general trend, $σ$0HH was higher than $σ$0VV,
  especially at the steeper incidence angles. By modeling CPD with maximum likelihood
  estimations, we found results consistent with double-bounce scatter in two Ludwigia
  plots, at certain scene incidence angles. Incidence angle accounted for most of
  the variation on $σ$0HH, whereas emergent green biomass was the main feature influencing
  $σ$0HV. Multivariate models explaining backscattering variation included the incidence
  angle and at least two of these variables: emergent plant height, stem diameter,
  number of green stems, and emergent green biomass. This study provides an example
  of using CPD to decide on the contribution of double-bounce scatter and highlights
  the influence of vegetation biomass on radar response. Even with the presence of
  water below vegetation, the contribution of double-bounce scatter to C-band backscattering
  depends on scene incidence angles and may be negligible in dense herbaceous targets.'
