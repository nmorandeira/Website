abstract: '© 2017 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis. Background:
  Floodplain wetlands feature high plant biodiversity, comprising variability in several
  organisation levels and at different scales. Aims: In a large river floodplain,
  we aimed to answer whether taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional $α$-diversity
  of herbaceous assemblages responded to hydrogeomorphic features conditioning the
  local flood pulse and/or to soil features; and to determine the relationship between
  $β$-diversity and geographic and environmental distances. Methods: Taxonomic, phylogenetic
  and functional $α$-diversity indices were computed in 82 sites in the Lower Paraná
  River floodplain. Relationships between $α$-diversity and environment were explored
  by generalised linear models. Spatial structure was assessed by semi-variograms.
  Responses of partitions of $β$-diversity to geographic or environmental distances
  were tested through multiple regressions in distance matrices. Results: Taxonomic
  and phylogenetic $α$-diversity show ed a similar pattern in relation to environment,
  especially to hydrogeomorphic features. The regression model fitted to species richness
  had the highest explanatory power. Regarding functional $α$-diversity, only the
  number of plant functional types responded to environmental features. Partitions
  of $β$-diversity, particularly the replacement of functional strategies, were better
  explained by environmental than by geographic distances. Conclusions: The diversity
  patterns of plant assemblages in a large river floodplain highlight the importance
  of heterogeneity conditioning the local effect of flood pulse regimes.'
