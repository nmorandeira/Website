 abstract = {Wetland ecosystems play a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. In emergent vegetation targets, the occurrence of double-bounce scatter is indicative of the presence of water and can be valuable for hydrological monitoring. Double-bounce scatter would lead to an increase of $σ$0HH over $σ$0VV and a non-zero co-polarized phase difference (CPD). In the Lower Paraná River floodplain, a total of 11 full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes from a wide range of incidence angles were acquired during a month. Flooded targets dominated by two herbaceous species were sampled: Schoenoplectus californicus (four sites, Bulrush marshes) and Ludwigia peruviana (three sites, Broadleaf marshes). As a general trend, $σ$0HH was higher than $σ$0VV, especially at the steeper incidence angles. By modeling CPD with maximum likelihood estimations, we found results consistent with double-bounce scatter in two Ludwigia plots, at certain scene incidence angles. Incidence angle accounted for most of the variation on $σ$0HH, whereas emergent green biomass was the main feature influencing $σ$0HV. Multivariate models explaining backscattering variation included the incidence angle and at least two of these variables: emergent plant height, stem diameter, number of green stems, and emergent green biomass. This study provides an example of using CPD to decide on the contribution of double-bounce scatter and highlights the influence of vegetation biomass on radar response. Even with the presence of water below vegetation, the contribution of double-bounce scatter to C-band backscattering depends on scene incidence angles and may be negligible in dense herbaceous targets.},
