abstract: Macrophytes play key functional and structural roles in floodplain shallow
  lakes (SL), determining the maintenance of ecosystem functions and sustaining several
  productive activities. We assessed the relationship between macrophyte community
  structure (composition, species abundance, and plant diversity) and environmental
  features (SL dynamics, connectivity, morphometry, flood frequency, and water and
  sediment physical and chemical variables) in the Lower Paraná River floodplain.
  Our main hypothesis was that SL macrophyte distribution depends on direct and indirect
  environmental controls operating at multiple scales. The SL dynamics during the
  April–November 2017 Paraná River pulse were described according to their coverage
  changes (vegetation, and turbid or clear open water), which were assessed with supervised
  classifications on Landsat 8-OLI scenes. Twenty-five SL of the Lower Paraná River
  floodplain were selected to represent all the SL dynamics identified. Ten SL were
  permanently connected and 15 were disconnected from watercourses. Water and sediment
  physical and chemical characteristics, macrophyte assemblage composition, and plant
  species abundance were surveyed at each site in the 2018 summer. Also, SL morphometric
  parameters and flood frequency were estimated from ancillary geographic data. The
  direct controlling factors of macrophyte assemblages were water ammonium and water
  nitrate concentrations, turbidity, and flood frequency. No clear effects of environmental
  conditions on macrophyte diversity were found. The connectivity of SL with watercourses
  affected their water and sediment physical and chemical features. Also, SL dynamics
  during the 2017 pulse were related to flood frequency. As connectivity to watercourses
  affects SL chemical and physical variables, and SL dynamics were associated with
  flood frequency, connectivity and SL dynamics indirectly influenced macrophyte assemblage
  composition. This study improved our understanding of macrophyte distribution patterns
  in the study area, which was related to several environmental variables operating
  at different scales. Our results highlight the importance of the variability of
  hydrological connectivity in promoting environmental heterogeneity in river floodplain
  systems, which is central to their functioning, and the high biodiversity that characterises
  these environments.
