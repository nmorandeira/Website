abstract: 'Human health risk in urban areas depends on multiple environmental features.
  We performeda year-round survey in a highly urbanized district located in temperate
  Argentina (GeneralSan Mart√≠n, Buenos Aires) to establish quality baseline information
  about environmentalhazards associated with health risk. Sampling was stratified
  in low and high hazardous zonesaccording to estimated indexes previously developed
  for the area for four hazards: drinkingwater and air pollution, and mosquito and
  rodent infestation. Water from wells showed lowerconcentrations of aluminum, manganese
  and iron, and higher values of arsenic than tapsamples, with records above the maximum
  permitted for arsenic, aluminum and chromium.Benzene concentration in air was higher
  in summer than in winter, and in areas close todumps and landfills, gas stations,
  high traffic pathways and industries with respect to lowhazard areas. Adult mosquito
  collections were more abundant in high hazardous areas, andpresented a seasonal
  pattern in which species of the genus Culex replaced themselves indifferent areas
  of the district. Rodent activity was recorded inside and outside dwellings, andits
  observed values did not differ between low and high hazardous areas. In the comparisonbetween
  field data and estimated hazard maps high accuracy was obtained for air pollutionmaps,
  intermediate accuracy for water pollution and mosquito infestation, and poor accuracyfor
  rodent infestation. How to improve field surveys and estimated maps are both discussed,highlighting
  the need for dynamic feedback between GIS-based models and environmentalmonitoring.'
